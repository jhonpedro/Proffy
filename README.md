Look, i need to learn about some concepts and libs to continue with this project, soo everything y'll see here is under development 🛠.

Let me list some things i likely need to learn just for finishing the 2.0 version of Proffy.

Yup -> Lib for value parsing and validations<br/>
Unform -> Lib for creating powerfull forms<br/>
Multer -> Lib for file upload<br/>
Need to learn about Context in React too, learn more about hooks and React Native, what i know now about RN is just what Diego developed in the NLW.<br/>
And about some patterns in the project. Learn about eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged...
<br/><br/>
I probably could finish the project with what i know now, but i think i would struggle with some logics, and i think those things up here will help me to finish more easily the project.
